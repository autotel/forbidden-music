# How to use layers

Layers can be helpful for composition, because they can let you show and hide different events, making selection easier. Having notes be separate in layers by musical role can facilitate re-arranging and trying different combinations.
It is also possible to create pieces with different timbres. Layers are used to separate which notes are assigned to which timbres. 

## Step by step

* If you do not see a 'layers' expandable section in the side panel, go to and expand the settings section in the same panel. There is a switch that enables the layers feature.
* Expand the 'layers' section by clicking on the exapandable section labeled 'layers'.
* Click on the [+] button to create a new layer.
* A new item in the layers list appears. Click on that list item to enter this layer.
* The new notes that you insert will be assigned to this layer.
* Select some notes that are in the default layer, and click on the [+] button that is inside the layer in the list. This will set the selected notes to that layer.
* Click on the eye icon to the left of the layer name to hide the notes in that layer. 
  * This also affects the scope of constraints. If you have relation constraints active, the notes in the hidden layer will not be taken into consideration for the constraints.
