# How to use loops

Loops were implemented to make composition more fun and fluid.

## Step by step

* Press the `l` key, or the `loop` button in the bottom right corner. This takes us to the loop mode. In loop mode, it is not possible to edit notes, only the loops.
* Move the mouse over the viewport. A line is shown at the mouse position. 
* Click on the viewport and drag to the right. A loop is created where the drag started, and ends where the drag ended. The loop is shown as a full-height rectangle.
* Press the `l` key again, or the `loop` button in the bottom right corner. This takes us back to the edit mode. The loop rectangles shrink to the top, and are still editable.
* Start the playback before, or inside the loop. The playback is going to repeat indefinitely the looped range (if repetitions are set to the default infinite).
* Insert some notes while the playback is running, inside the looped range and have some fun composing the loop.
* Press the `©` button on the loop rectangle, to copy the loop with it's contents to the right. The loop repetitions are going to be set to 4 and playback is going to follow eventually to the new loop range. 
* While the new loop is being repeated, modify the melody slightly. Once you are happy with the new loop, repeat the previous two steps for as long as you want. You can additionally lenghten or shorten the loop to produce more variations.

## Loop options

* When you select a loop, or while in loop mode, few buttons appear on each loop rectangle.
* The `-` button reduces the amount of loop repetitions. If the loop is set to infinite repetitions, this button has no effect.
* The `+` button increases the amount of loop repetitions. If the loop is set to infinite repetitions, this button has no effect.
* The `∅` button sets the loop repetitions to zero, effectively disabling the loop. This button is also useful to make the repetitions finite. 
* The `∞` button sets the loop repetitions to infinite.
* The `©` button copies the loop to the right, along with all the notes inside the loop range.
