# Piano roll to-do

## bugs
	it doesnt' take a lot to get the timing to break 
## GUI
	touch (two fingers pan/zoom, hold to add note)
	method for sending from layer to channel is confusing
## Basics & architecture
	

	tool to make sure sounds are on tune
	make it possible to set the base frequency upon which octaves are calculated
	dont fetch typographies from google
	mute layers
	better mechanisms to catch up if playback started mid note/automation 
		and if note begins before & ends after loop, to keep it playing as if it were midi
	Making a loop "copy to the right" should affect automation points too
## Need refactor
	problem: only first caller to synth.enable gets the correct promise.
		synth enable might be called more than once. Avoid this. Instead; when enable starts, synth creates and self-assigns a "waitReady" promise.
		this waitReady promise helps the module not re-enable, but wait for that prev promise, aswell as it serves other places where
		the synth is expected to be ready
	'credits' modal & 'monomode interaction' 
	automation - current methods for listing points while playing is suboptimal
	update documentation
	Synths should receive octave, as it's the variable that relates to human perception of tone; not frequency
	Should add a "voice mixer" or something like that argument; so that it's not necessary to redefine the voice creation method when the destination of voices is different than this.output
## Bottom pane version
	automation activation on bottompane
	controllers for the other type of parameters (option, array)

	add a synth chain that works 'per voice' - this way, some effects can respond to notes poliphonically, new synths can be created
	channel splitter; input is gain node with one channel, output is a gain node with two channels (or the same but in stereo) . 
		Also channel joiner
		allows creation of side-chain effects like gate, compressor-
	teleport, pair of modules that llow sending audio to arbitrary places. Might need delay for fedback loops
		audio sent to teleport could be used for modulation of some parameters
## Custom samplers	
	[tauri] load samples from a folder so that user can create their own samplers

## Granular sampler
    velocity to sample start
	automate some params (rel. sample start)

## Dev line
	auto compile, maybe https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-action

## Distribution & traffic care
	patreon login? 

## Whole new features
	drop sample in and use as sampler
	Midi MPE connectivity 
	Physical model sounds 
	Record and add percussive sounds
	Step sequencer for rhythms?
	Time or [time, octave] markers 
	switch between log and linear hz layouts for didactic purposes.
	integrate tuning explorer into this as a way to create scales
