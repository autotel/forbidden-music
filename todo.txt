# Piano roll to-do
	mutedness of notes are not represented in pixi
	Changing layer can cause a shift in the gui because the instrment might change, and is detrimental to dbl click
	"simultaneous" modifier status does not get saved
	when I select a note and then right-edge drag another note, the first note should be de-selected before drag starts
	Change app title 
	copied notes should keep their original group
	Better GUI for selecting snaps 
	make gui prettier?
	auto compile, maybe https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-action
	Throttle or otherwise reduce the amount of samples a visitor may download. ideas:

	Base Frequency selection
	karplus: manual graph of frequency to K. Lerper/extrapolator
	patreon login? 
	Midi MPE connectivity 
	group editing: finish or delete
		dragging a note grouped in another than active group, drags the whole group 
		copying a note grouped in another than active group, copies the whole group to new group
