# Piano roll to-do
	automation activation on bottompane
	controllers for the other type of parameters (option, array)

	patching: add a synth chain that works 'per voice' - this way, some effects can respond to notes poliphonically, new synths can be created
	patching: channel splitter; input is gain node with one channel, output is a gain node with two channels (or the same but in stereo) . 
		Also channel joiner
		allows creation of side-chain effects like gate, compressor-
	patching: teleport, pair of modules that llow sending audio to arbitrary places. Might need delay for fedback loops
		audio sent to teleport could be used for modulation of some parameters

    granular: velocity to sample start
	granular: automate some params (rel. sample start)

	make it possible to set the base frequency upon which octaves are calculated
	dont fetch typographies from google
	auto compile, maybe https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-action
	patreon login? 
	Midi MPE connectivity 
	
	Physical model sounds 
	Record and add percussive sounds
	Step sequencer for rhythms?
	Time or time*octave markers 
	"simultaneous" modifier status does not get saved

	switch between log and linear hz layouts for didactic purposes.
	integrate tuning explorer into this as a way to create scales
