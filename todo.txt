# Piano roll to-do

## bugs
	when clearing project or changing project, bottom pane focuses on no-longer existing synth chain
	Automations are not loaded 
## Basics & architecture
	tool to make sure sounds are on tune
	make it possible to set the base frequency upon which octaves are calculated
	dont fetch typographies from google
	mute layers
## Need refactor
	'credits' modal & 'monomode interaction' 
	automation
## Bottom pane version
	automation activation on bottompane
	controllers for the other type of parameters (option, array)

	add a synth chain that works 'per voice' - this way, some effects can respond to notes poliphonically, new synths can be created
	channel splitter; input is gain node with one channel, output is a gain node with two channels (or the same but in stereo) . 
		Also channel joiner
		allows creation of side-chain effects like gate, compressor-
	teleport, pair of modules that llow sending audio to arbitrary places. Might need delay for fedback loops
		audio sent to teleport could be used for modulation of some parameters
## Custom samplers	
	[tauri] load samples from a folder so that user can create their own samplers

## Granular sampler
    velocity to sample start
	automate some params (rel. sample start)

## Dev line
	auto compile, maybe https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-action

## Distribution & traffic care
	patreon login? 

## Whole new features
	drop sample in and use as sampler
	Midi MPE connectivity 
	Physical model sounds 
	Record and add percussive sounds
	Step sequencer for rhythms?
	Time or [time, octave] markers 
	switch between log and linear hz layouts for didactic purposes.
	integrate tuning explorer into this as a way to create scales
