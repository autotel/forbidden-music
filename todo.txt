# Piano roll to-do
## Bugs
	Often playback doesn't break out of a loop whose reps. have been decreased - Maybe I should tink of loops more like reaper regions than loops
## GUI
	touch (two fingers pan/zoom, hold to add note)
	method for sending from layer to channel is confusing
## Features
	A way to octave up or down notes without editing score - or octave the synths
	generative boxes - boxes in time/octave ranges that implement generative composition algos. good for live perf.
## Basics & architecture
	it doesnt' take a lot to get the timing to break - I wish to send the queuing frame & note listing to a thread
	make it possible to set the base frequency upon which octaves are calculated
	dont fetch typographies from google
	mute layers
	better mechanisms to catch up if playback started mid note/automation 
		and if note begins before & ends after loop, to keep it playing as if it were midi
	ToolLeftHand is mis-named - it was initially thought as complementary tool, but in practice it's a second layer that allows tool to return to its prev state
## Need refactor
	OptionSynthParam is unnecessarily complicated: why the neeed to specify displayvalue and value, if value field does not represent options' specified value??
	I'd like to convert workletfactories into workletmanager (see e.g. adsrWorkletManager opposed to other workletFactory files)
	'credits' modal & 'monomode interaction' 
	automation - current methods for listing points while playing is suboptimal
	update documentation
	Synths should receive octave, as it's the variable that relates to human perception of tone; not frequency
	Should add a "voice mixer" or something like that argument; so that it's not necessary to redefine the voice creation method when the destination of voices is different than this.output
## Bottom pane version
	automation activation on bottompane
	controllers for the other type of parameters (option, array)

	add a synth chain that works 'per voice' - this way, some effects can respond to notes poliphonically, new synths can be created
	channel splitter; input is gain node with one channel, output is a gain node with two channels (or the same but in stereo) . 
		Also channel joiner
		allows creation of side-chain effects like gate, compressor-
	teleport, pair of modules that llow sending audio to arbitrary places. Might need delay for fedback loops
		audio sent to teleport could be used for modulation of some parameters
## Custom samplers	
	[tauri] load samples from a folder so that user can create their own samplers

## Granular sampler
    velocity to sample start
	automate some params (rel. sample start)

## Dev line
	auto compile, maybe https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-action

## Distribution & traffic care
	patreon login? 

## Whole new features
	drop sample in and use as sampler
	Midi MPE connectivity 
	Physical model sounds 
	Record and add percussive sounds
	Step sequencer for rhythms?
	Time or [time, octave] markers 
	switch between log and linear hz layouts for didactic purposes.
	integrate tuning explorer into this as a way to create scales
