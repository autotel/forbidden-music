# Piano roll to-do
	create test to assert that v-constraints do not cause v modifications on notes when v movement is constrained off
	layers are not getting deleted
    granular: velocity to sample start
	granular: automate some params (rel. sample start)

	make it possible to set the base frequency upon which octaves are calculated
	on tauri, typographies mustn't be fetched from google
	auto compile, maybe https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-action
	Base Frequency selection
	patreon login? 
	Midi MPE connectivity 
	group editing: finish or delete
		dragging a note grouped in another than active group, drags the whole group 
		copying a note grouped in another than active group, copies the whole group to new group 
	Physical model sounds 
	Record and add percussive sounds
	Step sequencer for rhythms?
	Time or time*octave markers 
	"simultaneous" modifier status does not get saved
	mouse helper icon should represent what the mouse is doing, if tool is engaged in a drag, instead of showing what would do on click

# Ideas

	switch between log and linear hz layouts for didactic purposes.
	integrate tuning explorer into this as a way to construct scales
