# Piano roll to-do
	change how triggering notes work in the synth interface
	selectable-filtering approach instead of by tools, because it's getting very messy, like autocad perhaps	
		selectable (displayable * type visible)
		displayed (displayable * within screen range)
		displayable (layer visible * type visible)
		editable (type-visible)
		

	Throttle or otherwise reduce the amount of samples a visitor may download. ideas: 
		load button + load progrss instead of autoload 
		caching
	make it possible to set the base frequency upon which octaves are calculated
	on tauri, typographies mustn't be fetched from google
	auto compile, maybe https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-action
	Base Frequency selection
	patreon login? 
	Midi MPE connectivity 
	group editing: finish or delete
		dragging a note grouped in another than active group, drags the whole group 
		copying a note grouped in another than active group, copies the whole group to new group 
	Physical model sounds 
	Record and add percussive sounds
	Step sequencer for rhythms?
	Time or time*octave markers 
	"simultaneous" modifier status does not get saved
	mouse helper icon should represent what the mouse is doing, if tool is engaged in a drag, instead of showing what would do on click

# Ideas

	switch between log and linear hz layouts for didactic purposes.
	integrate tuning explorer into this as a way to construct scales

# Done

	change app icons
	changing window size deforms aspect ratio
	zooming doesn't keep exactly the aspect ratio as I want it.
	Better GUI for selecting snaps 
	make gui prettier?
	copied notes should keep their original group
	when I select a note and then right-edge drag another note, the first note should be de-selected before drag starts
	Changing layer can cause a shift in the gui because the instrment might change, and is detrimental to dbl click
	fix that after importing library item, instrument gui doesn't reflect changed instrument 
	Fix hanging notes in Firefox 
	public version with video 
	premium downloadable version (for piano spl) 
	Remove snaps that are not useful 
	zoom not around bottom left corner, but mouse or center of screen 
	Find midi export library or method 
	make playbar come back to last user selected spot on space
	canvas mode, faster 
	multi-timbrality 
	add a list of parameters to set each sampler - 
	fix notes sometimes skipped 
	mutedness of notes are not represented in pixi
	Change app title
